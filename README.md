Arduino Communication

Programmed for daisy chained Arduino Uno's connected to red, yellow, and green leds.

Select one Uno to be the Master and load the Master4_0.ino on to it.  

Then load as many uno's as you desire with the slave.ino changing the address for each to one on the Master file.

If you go above the 10 in the Master file be sure to add them there.  

Also be sure to truncate the list if you use less to avoid holes in the flashing sequence.
